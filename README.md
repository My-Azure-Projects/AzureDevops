# AzureDevOpsAngularDemo



This project was created as a personal learning process. 
It is a simple example implementation of Azure Devops & Nodejs Application (Angular) with JUnit & Cobertura. 
Feel free to clone this repo or check it out [here](https://dev.azure.com/dbma-dev/AzureDevOpsAngular) to test it on your own repo.

Thanks.

The process can be reversed (i.e. Webstorm > Azure > github) if desired.
